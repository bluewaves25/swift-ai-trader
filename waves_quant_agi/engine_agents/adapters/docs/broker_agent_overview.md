Adapters Agent Overview
Mission
The Adapters Agent ensures seamless communication with multiple brokers by translating internal orders into broker-specific formats, managing integrations, monitoring broker health, handling retries, learning from failures, and adapting to API changes while logging all activities.
Behavior

Translation: Converts internal order formats to broker-specific formats using OrderNormalizer and broker adapters.
Routing: Selects optimal brokers via BrokerRouter based on strategies like lowest fees or fastest routes.
Monitoring: Tracks broker health and performance with HealthChecker and PerformanceTracker.
Resilience: Manages retries with exponential backoff using RetryHandler.
Learning: Analyzes patterns and generates recommendations via PatternAnalyzer and BrokerIntelligence.
Updating: Monitors and adapts to broker API changes with APIMonitor.
Logging: Records all actions, errors, and metrics using BrokerLogger.

Dependencies

External Libraries:
ccxt.async_support: For broker API interactions (Binance, Coinbase).
requests: For HTTP-based API calls (Exness, health checks).
asyncio: For asynchronous operations.
logging: For persistent logging with rotation.


Internal Modules:
broker_integrations/: Adapter implementations for Binance, Coinbase, Exness.
router/: Broker selection and routing logic.
normalizer/: Order standardization.
status_monitor/: Health and performance tracking.
retry_engine/: Retry logic.
learning_layer/: Failure analysis and recommendations.
broker_updater/: API change monitoring.
logs/: Logging infrastructure.



Scalability

Modular design allows adding new brokers by extending BaseAdapter.
Routing strategies can be extended in routing_strategies.py.
Learning and monitoring components are broker-agnostic.
Logging uses rotating files to manage disk space.
