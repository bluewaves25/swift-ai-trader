Coordination Models Documentation
Overview
Coordination models define how the Intelligence Agent optimizes agent interactions, stored in Redis and updated via internal/external data.
Model Structure
Stored in intelligence:coordination_model and intelligence:orchestration_model:
{
  "task": {
    "agents": [str],
    "priority": str,  // e.g., "resolve_conflict", "optimize_coordination"
    "score": float   // Performance or relevance score
  }
}

Example
{
  "trade_execution": {
    "agents": ["FeesMonitor", "Strategy"],
    "priority": "resolve_conflict",
    "score": 0.4
  }
}

Components

CorrelationMatrix: Identifies metric correlations (e.g., speed vs. cost).
AnomalyDetector: Flags performance outliers (>2 std deviations).
TimingWindowOptimizer: Adjusts execution timing to reduce overlap (>10%).
AgentGraphBuilder: Constructs agent relationship graphs.
CoordinationGNN: Trains GNN for coordination optimization.
FeedbackLoopMonitor: Detects feedback loops (>0.8 weight).
ReinforcementScorer: Assigns rewards based on performance.
InterAgentTransformer: Models interactions with BERT embeddings.
ConflictResolver: Resolves task conflicts via transformer analysis.
ModelExplainer: Generates decision explanations.
ResearchEngine: Analyzes internal coordination patterns.
TrainingModule: Trains coordination models.
AgentFusionEngine: Fuses internal/external insights.
OrchestrationTrainer: Trains hybrid models.

Usage

Initialization: Models loaded from Redis (ModelLoader equivalent or direct Redis access).
Training: TrainingModule.train_model() and OrchestrationTrainer.train_model() update policies.
Application: Policies applied via CoordinationGNN.optimize_coordination() or ConflictResolver.resolve_conflicts().
Updates: External data from AILabScraper, OrchestrationCases, ArchitectureMonitor refreshes models.

Scalability

Supports new tasks/agents via JSON updates.
Redis caching ensures efficient access.
Configurable fields allow additional metrics (e.g., latency, risk).
