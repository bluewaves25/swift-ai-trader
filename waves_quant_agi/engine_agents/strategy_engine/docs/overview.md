Strategy Engine Overview
Mission
The Quantum Supply-Demand Intelligence Agent's strategy engine drives adaptive, high-performance trading across Forex, Crypto, Indices, and Commodities, leveraging quantum-inspired algorithms and AI-driven learning to maximize profitability and minimize risk.
Goals

Adaptivity: Dynamically adjust strategies (e.g., momentum_rider.py, fed_policy_detector.py) to market conditions.
Profitability: Optimize trades for assets like EUR/USD, BTC, and Gold using Fee Monitor integration.
Robustness: Ensure reliability via FailureAgentLogger and IncidentCache.
Scalability: Support new strategies and assets via modular design.

Evolution

Phase 1: Core strategies (arbitrage_based/, trend_following/) for high-frequency trading.
Phase 2: Advanced strategies (statistical_arbitrage/, news_driven/) for multi-asset trading.
Phase 3: Learning layer (research_engine.py, training_module.py) for self-adaptive optimization.
Phase 4: External intelligence (ai_lab_scraper.py, agent_fusion_engine.py) for enhanced decision-making.
Future: Integrate quantum algorithms (e.g., q_interpreter.py with Qiskit) and social signals (e.g., rumor_spread_mapper.py).

Key Components

Strategy Types: Arbitrage, trend-following, statistical arbitrage, news-driven, market-making, high time frame.
Learning Layer: Failure analysis, retraining, external intelligence fusion.
Integration: Seamless data flow with Market Conditions, Executions, Risk Management, and Fee Monitor agents via Redis.

Principles

WAISC Philosophy: Wealth augmentation through intelligent, scalable coordination.
Modularity: Independent modules (e.g., orchestration_cases.py) for easy extension.
Resilience: Error handling and logging ensure continuous operation.

Future Enhancements

Add special modules (e.g., quantum_spike_resolver.py in market_conditions/anomalies/).
Incorporate X API for real-time social sentiment in agent_sentiment.py.
Expand quantum integration with qiskit in quantum_core/.
