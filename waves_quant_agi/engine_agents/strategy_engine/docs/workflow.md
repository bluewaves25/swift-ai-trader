Strategy Orchestration Workflow
Overview
The strategy orchestration workflow coordinates trading strategies within the Quantum Supply-Demand Intelligence Agent, ensuring seamless integration with Market Conditions, Executions, Risk Management, and Fee Monitor agents. It supports Forex (e.g., EUR/USD), Crypto (e.g., BTC, ETH), Indices (e.g., S&P 500), and Commodities (e.g., Gold).
Workflow Steps

Market Data Ingestion:

Market Conditions Agent collects real-time data via Redis (market_conditions_output).
Data includes price, volatility, liquidity, sentiment, and macro indicators.


Strategy Execution:

Strategies in types/ (e.g., latency_arbitrage.py, momentum_rider.py) process data.
Generate signals (buy/sell/hold) based on thresholds (e.g., price_diff_threshold, momentum_threshold).
Signals stored in Redis and logged via FailureAgentLogger.


Signal Coordination:

learning_layer/external/orchestration_cases.py prioritizes strategies (>0.8 priority score).
agent_fusion_engine.py fuses signals for unified action.


Execution:

Signals sent to Executions Agent via Redis (execution_agent).
Fee Monitor Agent ensures cost efficiency (e.g., fee_score checks).


Learning and Optimization:

learning_layer/internal/research_engine.py analyzes failures (>10% failure rate).
training_module.py retrains models if accuracy <0.6.
retraining_loop.py triggers periodic retraining (every 24 hours).


Monitoring and Feedback:

architecture_monitor.py tracks system stability (<0.9 stability score triggers alerts).
system_predictor.py forecasts performance for continuous improvement.



Integration Points

Redis Channels: strategy_engine_output, execution_agent, training_module.
Agents: Market Conditions (data), Risk Management (risk checks), Fee Monitor (cost optimization).
Assets: Forex, Crypto, Indices, Commodities.

Scalability

Modular design allows adding new strategies (e.g., regime_shift_detector.py).
Configurable thresholds ensure adaptability across markets.

Error Handling

FailureAgentLogger logs issues; IncidentCache stores incidents for analysis.
Errors trigger notifications to Core Agent for resolution.
