   - Consider different market conditions
   - Include major market events

2. **Set Strategy Parameters** ⚙️
   - Risk per trade (usually 1-2% of capital)
   - Stop-loss and take-profit levels
   - Position sizing rules
   - Entry/exit criteria

3. **Run Backtest** 🚀
   - System processes historical data
   - Applies strategy rules
   - Records all trades and outcomes

4. **Analyze Results** 📊
   - Total return and drawdown
   - Win rate and profit factor
   - Sharpe ratio and risk metrics
   - Trade distribution analysis

### **Backtesting Best Practices:**

✅ **Use Realistic Data**
- Include transaction costs
- Account for slippage
- Use actual bid/ask spreads

✅ **Test Multiple Time Periods**
- Bull markets, bear markets
