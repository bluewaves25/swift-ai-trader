Failure Prevention Agent Overview
Mission
Ensure trading system reliability by monitoring health, activating recovery mechanisms, analyzing failures, stress testing, and learning from internal and external data.
Behavior

Monitoring: Tracks CPU, memory, agents, data integrity, network, and dependencies.
Resilience: Triggers circuit breakers (BrokerBreaker, StrategyBreaker, TradeHaltSwitch) and fallbacks (FallbackManager).
Analytics: Classifies failures (FailureClassifier) and generates resilience reports (ResilienceReport).
Stress Testing: Simulates load and network spikes (LoadSimulator, NetworkSpike).
Learning: Analyzes internal failures (ResearchEngine) and external data (TechnicalScraper, MarketSentiment, IndustryMonitor), trains models (MultiSourceTrainer), and issues alerts (PredictiveAlerts).

Dependencies

External Libraries:
psutil: System monitoring.
redis: Caching and logging.
requests, BeautifulSoup: Web scraping.
tweepy: Social media sentiment.
vaderSentiment: NLP for sentiment analysis.


Internal Modules:
monitor/: System, agent, and data checks.
circuit_breakers/: Safety mechanisms.
redundancy/: Fallback and sync validation.
infrastructure/: Network and dependency monitoring.
stress_tests/: Load and failure simulation.
learning_layer/: Internal/external failure analysis and training.
memory/: Incident storage.
logs/: Logging.



Scalability

Modular components for easy addition of checks or data sources.
Redis ensures low-latency caching and logging.
Learning layer adapts to new failure patterns via RetrainingLoop and MultiSourceTrainer.
Configurable thresholds for monitoring and breakers.
