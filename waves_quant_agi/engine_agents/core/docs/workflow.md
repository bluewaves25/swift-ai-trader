Core Agent Workflow
The Core Agent operates in a circular process to validate, route, and coordinate trading signals. Below is the workflow:

Signal Reception:

Receives trading signal from strategy agent via AgentIO.
Example: {"signal_id": "123", "strategy": "momentum", "params": {"amount": 0.1, "base": "BTC", "quote": "USDT"}, "timestamp": 1234567890.0}.


Signal Validation:

SignalFilter validates signal format and strategy using validate_signal.
Invalid signals are rejected and logged via CoreAgentLogger.


Logic Execution:

LogicExecutor processes signal through logic tree, checking risk compliance via FlowManager.
Example: If risk check passes, create TradeCommand.


Agent Coordination:

FlowManager coordinates with strategy and risk agents via AgentIO.
Ensures signal approval before proceeding.


Command Packaging:

ExecutionPipeline builds command package from TradeCommand and sends to execution agent.


Context Storage:

RecentContext stores signal, rejection, or PnL snapshot for future analysis.
Example: store_signal(signal), store_rejection(signal_id, reason).


Learning Integration:

ResearchEngine analyzes behavior and market data.
TrainingModule prepares datasets, and RetrainingLoop updates models periodically.


Feedback Loop:

Analysis and retraining results feed back to LogicExecutor and FlowManager to adapt logic.
Process repeats for the next signal.



Circular Nature
The workflow loops continuously, refining validation, routing, and coordination through learning and context updates. All actions are logged for traceability.
