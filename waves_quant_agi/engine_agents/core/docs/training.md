Training the Core Agent
Training Objectives
Optimize the Core Agent's signal validation, logic execution, and agent coordination by training the learning layer with historical and simulated data.
1. Data Collection

Context Data:
Gather signals, rejections, and PnL snapshots from RecentContext.
Example: context.get_recent_signals(), context.get_recent_rejections().


Agent Responses:
Collect responses from strategy, risk, and execution agents via AgentIO.


Market Data:
Use ResearchEngine to collect external market data (e.g., price, volatility).


Logs:
Extract action and error logs from logs/*.log for behavior analysis.



2. Training Scenarios

Signal Analysis:
Analyze signals with varying strategies, amounts, and market conditions.
Example: {"signal_id": "signal1", "strategy": "momentum", "params": {"amount": 0.1, "base": "BTC", "quote": "USDT"}}.


Failure Analysis:
Analyze risk violations or agent failures to improve SignalFilter and FlowManager.


Edge Case Analysis:
Analyze invalid signals or extreme market conditions to ensure robustness.



3. Training the Learning Layer

Research Engine:
Analyze behavior with ResearchEngine.analyze_behavior() to identify rejection patterns and signal trends.
Example: Detect frequent rejections due to "Exposure limit exceeded".


Training Module:
Prepare datasets with TrainingModule.prepare_dataset() combining signals, rejections, and PnL.
Train model with TrainingModule.train_model(dataset) to optimize decision logic.


Retraining Loop:
Schedule RetrainingLoop.run_retraining() to periodically update models with new data.



4. Validation

Logic Validation:
Test LogicExecutor with simulated signals to ensure correct routing and rejections.


Performance Metrics:
Evaluate training accuracy and rejection rates using ResearchEngine outputs.


Log Review:
Verify CoreAgentLogger captures all training actions and errors.



5. Best Practices

Diverse Data: Include varied signal types and market conditions in datasets.
Incremental Training: Retrain periodically with small datasets to avoid overfitting.
Traceability: Log all training actions for debugging and auditing.
Scalability: Ensure datasets can accommodate new strategies or agents.
Simulation: Use mock agent responses to test coordination without live execution.

Example Training Script
from core.memory.recent_context import RecentContext
from core.learning_layer import ResearchEngine, TrainingModule, RetrainingLoop

context = RecentContext()
research = ResearchEngine(context)
training = TrainingModule(context)
retraining = RetrainingLoop(training, context)

# Store signals for analysis
context.store_signal({"signal_id": "signal1", "strategy": "momentum", "params": {"amount": 0.1}, "timestamp": 1234567890.0})

# Analyze behavior
analysis = research.analyze_behavior()

# Train model
dataset = training.prepare_dataset()
training.train_model(dataset)
