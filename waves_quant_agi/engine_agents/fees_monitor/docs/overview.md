Fees Monitor Agent Overview
Purpose
The Fees Monitor Agent ensures trading profitability by tracking, analyzing, and optimizing costs (fees, slippage) across trades, brokers, and strategies. It prevents silent profitability erosion through real-time monitoring, cost optimization, and learning from internal and external data.
Key Responsibilities

Fee Model Awareness:

Loads and normalizes broker fee models (e.g., commissions, swaps) from broker_fee_db.json.
Updates models with scraped data (BrokerScraper) and regulatory changes (RegulationMonitor).


Execution-Level Insight:

Detects slippage (SlippageDetector) and attributes causes (e.g., latency, market depth) via ExecutionDelta.
Analyzes slippage variance (VarianceAnalyzer) to identify inconsistent broker performance.


Adaptive Cost Optimization:

Adjusts position sizes (SmartSizer) to keep fees below 1% of trade value.
Recommends execution methods (ExecutionRecommender) and maps strategies to low-fee brokers (FeeStrategyMap).


Net Profitability Accounting:

Adjusts PnL for fees/slippage (PnlAdjuster).
Detects hidden fees (HiddenFeeDetector) and generates weekly profitability reports (TrueProfitReporter).


Learning Layer:

Internal: Analyzes trade logs (ResearchEngine), trains models (TrainingModule), and updates daily (RetrainingLoop).
External: Scrapes fees (BrokerScraper), monitors forums (ForumChecker), and tracks regulations (RegulationMonitor).
Social Analysis: Processes complaint sentiment (FeeSentimentProcessor) and correlates trends (TrendCorrelator).
Fusion: Synthesizes patterns (CostPatternSynthesizer) and predicts anomalies (AnomalyPredictor).
Hybrid Training: Trains on combined data (FeeTrainer) and validates against external sources (ExternalFeeValidator).



Architecture

Modular: Independent modules with clear interfaces (e.g., detect_slippage, train_model).
Scalable: Supports new brokers, symbols, and data sources via config and Redis caching.
Robust: Error handling with logging (FailureAgentLogger) and caching (IncidentCache) in Redis.
Powerful: Combines internal trade analysis with external data (web, social media) for proactive cost management.

Integration

Input: Trade data from Data Feed Agent via Redis (e.g., {"broker": "binance", "symbol": "BTCUSD", "price": 50000}).
Output: Publishes issues/reports to Redis channels (e.g., "fee_incident") for Core Agent.
Dependencies: redis, requests, BeautifulSoup, vaderSentiment.

Folder Structure

broker_fee_models/: Manages fee data loading and normalization.
slippage_tracker/: Tracks and analyzes execution costs.
cost_optimizer/: Optimizes trade sizes and execution methods.
profitability_audit/: Ensures accurate profitability reporting.
learning_layer/: Combines internal/external data for cost prediction.
docs/: Comprehensive documentation (workflow, fee models, training, APIs, integration).

Scalability & Extensibility

Add new brokers via broker_fee_db.json and scrape_urls.
Extend learning with ML models (e.g., scikit-learn) in FeeTrainer.
Support new external sources (e.g., X, Reddit) via config.

Use Case
Ensures trading strategies remain profitable by minimizing costs in high-frequency trading, detecting hidden fees, and adapting to market or regulatory changes.
