## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from trading_engine import TradingEngine

# Create engine instance
engine = TradingEngine()

# Start the engine
await engine.start_trading_engine()

# Get engine status
status = engine.get_engine_status()
print(f"Engine state: {status['state']}")

# Stop the engine
await engine.stop_trading_engine()
```

### Running the Engine

```bash
# Run the trading engine directly
python trading_engine.py

# Run tests
python test_trading_engine.py
```

### Integration with Existing System

The trading engine is designed to integrate with the existing agent system:

1. **Redis Communication**: Uses Redis for inter-agent communication
2. **BaseAgent Integration**: Leverages shared utilities from BaseAgent
3. **Timing Coordination**: Integrates with SimplifiedTimingCoordinator
4. **Agent Coordination**: Communicates with all other agents via Redis queues

## Redis Queues

The trading engine uses the following Redis queues for communication:

- `hft_signals`: Ultra-HFT signals (arbitrage, market making)
- `strategy_signals`: Strategy signals from strategy engine
- `execution_orders`: Orders sent to execution agent
- `position_updates`: Position updates from execution agent
- `trading_commands`: Commands from API/control interface
- `market_analysis_requests`: Requests to market conditions agent
- `coordination_messages`: Inter-agent coordination
- `risk_assessment_requests`: Risk assessment requests
- `optimization_requests`: Portfolio optimization requests
- `trading_stats`: Trading statistics and metrics
- `system_health`: System health information
- `position_stats`: Position statistics

## Position Management

### Position Lifecycle

1. **Signal Reception**: Receive trading signal from strategy engine
2. **Position Creation**: Create position with strategy-specific parameters
3. **Execution**: Send to execution agent via Redis
4. **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of position health
5. **Exit Conditions**: Check stop loss, take profit, and strategy conditions
6. **Position Closure**: Close position when conditions are met
7. **History Tracking**: Maintain position history and statistics

### Strategy-Specific Handling

- **Trend Following**: Monitors trend reversal for exit
- **Mean Reversion**: Checks if price returned to mean
- **Breakout**: Validates breakout success/failure
- **Generic**: Standard position management

## Error Handling

The trading engine includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues operation even if Redis is unavailable
- **Exception Recovery**: Catches and logs all exceptions without crashing
- **State Management**: Maintains consistent state even during errors
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all operations and errors

## Testing

### Test Script

The `test_trading_engine.py` script provides comprehensive testing:

- **Basic Functionality**: Tests instantiation, state management, and methods
- **Cycle Operations**: Tests engine start/stop and cycle execution
- **Error Handling**: Tests graceful handling of missing dependencies

### Running Tests

```bash
python test_trading_engine.py
```

## Dependencies

### Required (Built-in)
- `asyncio`: Async/await support
- `logging`: Logging functionality
- `json`: JSON data handling
- `time`: Time and timing functions
- `datetime`: Date and time handling
- `typing`: Type hints
- `enum`: Enumerations

### Optional
- `redis`: Redis client for inter-agent communication
- `numpy`: Numerical operations (enhancement)
- `pandas`: Data manipulation (enhancement)

## Configuration

The trading engine is designed to work with minimal configuration:

- **Logging**: Automatic setup with INFO level
- **Redis**: Optional, with graceful fallback
- **Timing**: Automatic timing coordination
- **Cycles**: Pre-configured timing for all tiers

## Monitoring and Control

### Status Monitoring

```python
# Get comprehensive status
status = engine.get_engine_status()

# Get Redis status
redis_status = engine.get_redis_status()

# Check if engine is running
is_running = engine.is_running
```

### Command Control

The engine responds to commands via Redis:

- `{"action": "stop", "target": "trading"}`: Stop the engine
- `{"action": "pause", "target": "trading"}`: Pause trading
- `{"action": "resume", "target": "trading"}`: Resume trading

## Performance Characteristics

- **Ultra-HFT**: 1ms cycle time for arbitrage
- **Fast**: 100ms cycle time for strategies
- **Tactical**: 30s cycle time for analysis
- **Strategic**: 5min cycle time for optimization
- **Position Management**: 1s cycle time for monitoring

## Integration Points

1. **Strategy Engine**: Receives trading signals
2. **Execution Agent**: Sends execution orders
3. **Risk Management**: Requests risk assessments
4. **Market Conditions**: Requests market analysis
5. **Data Feeds**: Receives price data
6. **Communication Hub**: Coordinates with all agents

3. **Performance Analytics**: Advanced performance metrics
4. **Backtesting**: Historical strategy validation
5. **Multi-Asset Support**: Extended asset class support

### Extensibility

The trading engine is designed for easy extension:

- **New Strategy Types**: Easy addition of new strategies
- **Custom Exit Conditions**: Strategy-specific exit logic
- **Additional Tiers**: Extensible tier architecture
- **Plugin System**: Modular enhancement system

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Redis Connection Failed**: Engine continues with limited functionality
2. **Agent Communication Issues**: Logs errors and continues operation
3. **Cycle Execution Errors**: Individual cycles continue, others unaffected
4. **Position Management Errors**: Logs errors and maintains system stability

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by modifying the logging level in the `__init__` method:

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Support

For issues or questions:

1. Check the logs for error messages
2. Run the test script to verify functionality
3. Check Redis connectivity if using inter-agent communication
4. Review the agent integration points

## Conclusion

This trading engine provides a complete, production-ready implementation of the 4-tier architecture discussed. It includes comprehensive position management, strategy handling, and system monitoring, making it suitable for both development and production trading environments.
