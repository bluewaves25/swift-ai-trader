Feed Integration Guide
Purpose
Integrate the Data Feed Agent with Core and Strategy Agents for seamless data flow.
Integration Steps

Configure Redis Channels:

Use RealtimePublisher to send data to channels (e.g., "crypto_price", "trading_signal").
Configure Core Agent's AgentIO to subscribe to these channels via RealtimeSubscriber.
Example:from data_feeds.stream.realtime_subscriber import RealtimeSubscriber
subscriber = RealtimeSubscriber()
asyncio.run(subscriber.subscribe(["crypto_price"], lambda data: print(data)))




Data Schema Alignment:

Ensure Core Agent expects schemas defined in SchemaValidator (e.g., price, order book).
Update core/interfaces/agent_io.py to handle Data Feed schemas.
Example schema for price:schema = {"exchange": str, "symbol": str, "price": float, "volume": float, "timestamp": float}




Add New Feed:

Create new feed class in appropriate module (e.g., price/new_feed.py).
Implement fetch and stream methods similar to CryptoPriceFeed.
Update data_feeds/__init__.py to expose the new class.
Register channel in RealtimePublisher.


Learning Layer Integration:

Feed data to ResearchEngine and TrainingModule for analysis and retraining.
Example:from data_feeds.learning_layer.research_engine import ResearchEngine
from data_feeds.cache.db_connector import DBConnector
db = DBConnector()
research = ResearchEngine(db)
analysis = research.analyze_feed_behavior("crypto_price:*")




Testing:

Simulate data feeds with mock data to test Core Agent integration.
Verify data in Redis using DBConnector.retrieve.
Check logs for errors in DataCleaner, SchemaValidator.



Best Practices

Use consistent Redis channel names across agents.
Validate all incoming data with SchemaValidator in Core Agent.
Monitor latency with data_latency.md guidelines.
Log all integration actions in Redis for traceability.
Test with varied data types (price, sentiment, signals) to ensure robustness.
