Execution Workflow
The QUANTUM_AGENTS Execution Agent follows a streamlined workflow for trade execution, ensuring speed, safety, and optimization.
Workflow Steps

Signal Receipt: api_bridge.rs receives trade signals via gRPC/REST from external systems (e.g., Strategy Engine).
Risk Validation: risk_filters.rs checks max daily loss and order size limits.
Slippage Check: slippage_controller.rs ensures execution within safe price bands.
Execution Routing: execution_logic.rs selects optimal broker and timing based on latency and Python recommendations.
Trade Execution: order_executor.rs places trades via broker_interface.rs.
Metrics Collection: latency_monitor.rs tracks execution latency; metrics stored in Redis.
Feedback Loop: Python learning_layer/ analyzes metrics (research_engine.py), trains models (training_module.py), and updates parameters (retraining_loop.py).

Integration

Communicates with Market Conditions and Fee Monitor via Redis (execution_output channel).
Uses PyO3 to receive Python parameter updates (e.g., slippage buffers).
Logs all actions for auditability (7-day expiry in Redis).

Error Handling

Failed trades trigger retries via order_executor.rs.
Anomalies (e.g., high latency) prompt retraining via retraining_loop.py.
