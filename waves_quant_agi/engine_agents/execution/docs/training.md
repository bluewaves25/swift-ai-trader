Training Protocols
The QUANTUM_AGENTS Execution Agent uses a Python-based learning_layer/ to optimize execution parameters (e.g., timing, sizing, slippage buffers) through continuous learning and retraining.
Protocols

Periodic Retraining: retraining_loop.py triggers every 7 days (retrain_interval) or when anomaly rates exceed 15% (anomaly_threshold).
Anomaly-Based Retraining: Initiated when execution errors (e.g., high slippage, latency) exceed 10% (error_threshold).
Training Process: training_module.py trains models on execution metrics (e.g., latency, fill rates), targeting 85% accuracy (accuracy_threshold).
Data Sources: Metrics from rust_data_collector.py and Redis (e.g., execution:metric:* keys).
Output: Trained models exported via export_weights.py to Rust via PyO3.

Implementation

Data Flow: Execution metrics collected via rust_data_collector.py, analyzed by research_engine.py, and used for training.
Validation: external_strategy_validator.py ensures external inputs align with execution goals.
Storage: Models and logs stored in Redis with 7-day expiry.
Notifications: Results published to execution_output and execution_logic Redis channels.

Scope

Focuses on execution-specific optimization (e.g., broker selection, order timing).
Supports Forex, Crypto, Indices, and Commodities.
Ensures autonomy with no human intervention post-stabilization.
