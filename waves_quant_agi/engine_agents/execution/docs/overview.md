QUANTUM_AGENTS Execution Agent Overview
The QUANTUM_AGENTS Execution Agent is a high-performance, autonomous system for ultra-fast trade execution in high-frequency trading (HFT) across Forex, Crypto, Indices, and Commodities. Built with Rust for speed and Python for intelligence, it focuses solely on execution, ensuring low latency, safety, and optimization.
Goals

Speed: Sub-millisecond trade execution via Rust.
Safety: Robust risk controls (slippage, loss limits, circuit breakers).
Intelligence: Python-based learning optimizes execution parameters (timing, sizing).
Independence: Operates autonomously, integrating with external systems via Redis.
Scalability: Modular design supports multiple brokers and models.

Philosophy

Execution Focus: Handles trade execution, not strategy generation.
Modularity: Decoupled components for easy swaps (brokers, models).
Autonomy: Continuous learning and parameter updates without human intervention.
Transparency: Logs and metrics ensure auditability.

Key Features

Rust core/ executes trades with dynamic routing (execution_logic.rs).
Python learning_layer/ refines execution via patterns and retraining.
PyO3 enables Rust-Python integration for real-time feedback.
Redis ensures communication with Market Conditions and Fee Monitor agents.
