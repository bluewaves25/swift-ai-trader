# Risk Management Complete Guide 🛡️

## What is the Risk Management Agent?

The Risk Management Agent is your trading system's **safety net**. Think of it as a vigilant security guard that:
- **Protects your capital** from excessive losses
- **Monitors all trades** for risk violations
- **Enforces trading limits** automatically
- **Prevents system failures** with circuit breakers

## How Risk Management Works 🔒

### 1. **Trade Validation Stage** ✅
- Receives trading signals from Strategy Engine
- Checks if trade meets risk criteria
- Validates position sizing
- Ensures portfolio limits aren't exceeded

### 2. **Portfolio Monitoring Stage** 📊
- Tracks current positions
- Monitors portfolio exposure
- Calculates risk metrics
- Identifies potential problems

### 3. **Risk Assessment Stage** 🧮
- Calculates potential losses
- Assesses market risk
- Evaluates correlation risk
- Determines overall risk level

### 4. **Decision Stage** 🎯
- Approves safe trades
- Rejects risky trades
- Suggests position adjustments
- Triggers emergency actions if needed

### 5. **Monitoring Stage** 👀
- Tracks approved trades
- Monitors position changes
- Updates risk metrics
- Records all decisions
