Learning and Retraining Protocols
The learning_layer/ in risk_management/ ensures continuous improvement of risk models.
Protocols

Periodic Retraining: RetrainingLoop triggers every 7 days or when anomalies exceed 15% (anomaly_threshold).
Anomaly-Based Retraining: Initiated by FailurePatternSynthesizer when failure rates exceed 10% (failure_threshold).
Training Process: TrainingModule uses historical data to train models, targeting 85% accuracy (model_accuracy_threshold).
External Data Integration: AILabScraper and AgentSentiment incorporate web and social insights.

Implementation

Training data sourced from IncidentCache and Redis.
Results published to model_deployment channel for validated models.
Failures logged via FailureAgentLogger for analysis.
Supports strategies across Forex, Crypto, Indices, and Commodities.

Monitoring

ResearchEngine analyzes failure patterns to prioritize retraining.
OrchestrationTrainer refines strategy coordination logic.
All processes logged with 7-day expiry for audit trails.
