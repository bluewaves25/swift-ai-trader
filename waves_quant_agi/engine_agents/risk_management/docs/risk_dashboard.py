Graceful Loss Handling Strategies
The risk_management/ module minimizes losses through proactive strategies.
Strategies

Fallback Plans: GracefulFallbackEngine enforces low-risk plans (1% max risk) when entropy exceeds 80%.
Position Adjustments: Triggered by ExecutionAgent notifications for high-risk scenarios (e.g., rumor-driven volatility).
Capital Protection: ExposureControl limits per-asset (10%) and portfolio (50%) exposure.
Recovery Analysis: RecoveryAnalyzer ensures recovery times stay below 1 day (recovery_time_threshold).

Implementation

Integrates with quantum_risk_core/ for entropy-driven decisions.
Uses Redis for real-time coordination with Executions and Fee Monitor agents.
Logs loss events via FailureAgentLogger with 7-day expiry.
Visualized via OutcomeVisualizer for transparency.

Scope

Covers Forex, Crypto, Indices, and Commodities.
Mitigates risks from market regimes, volatility spikes, and system instability.
