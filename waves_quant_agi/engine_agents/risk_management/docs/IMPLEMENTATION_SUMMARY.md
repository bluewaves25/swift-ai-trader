    'max_leverage': 1.2,            # 1.2x leverage
    'trailing_stop_enabled': True,  # ✅ Trailing stop enabled
    'trailing_stop_distance': 0.005, # 0.5% distance
    'trailing_stop_activation': 0.01, # 1% profit activation
    'trailing_stop_tightening': 0.002 # 0.2% tightening
}

# HTF Strategy
'htf': {
    'max_position_size': 0.20,      # 20% of portfolio
    'max_leverage': 1.0,            # No leverage
    'trailing_stop_enabled': True,  # ✅ Trailing stop enabled
    'trailing_stop_distance': 0.01, # 1% distance
    'trailing_stop_activation': 0.015, # 1.5% profit activation
    'trailing_stop_tightening': 0.005 # 0.5% tightening
}
```

### Performance Thresholds
```python
'performance_thresholds': {
    'max_daily_portfolio_loss': 0.02,    # 2% maximum daily loss
    'min_weekly_reward_target': 0.20,    # 20% minimum weekly reward
    'portfolio_loss_circuit_breaker': True,  # Enable circuit breaker
    'reward_optimization_enabled': True      # Enable weekly optimization
}
```

## 🚀 System Workflow

### 1. Portfolio Risk Management
```
Portfolio Update → Calculate Daily P&L → Check 2% Limit → 
Circuit Breaker (if breached) → Close All Positions → Reset Next Day
```

### 2. Trailing Stop Management
```
New Position → Check Strategy Eligibility → Initialize Trailing Stop → 
Monitor Price → Activate on Profit → Tighten Stop → Trigger Exit
```

### 3. Weekly Performance Tracking
```
Weekly Update → Calculate P&L → Check 20% Target → 
Optimize Risk Strategy → Monitor Progress → Reset Next Week
```

### 4. Real-Time Monitoring
```
Position Updates (60s) → Portfolio Updates (5min) → 
System Health (30s) → Alert Generation → Circuit Breaker Activation
```

## 🔒 Circuit Breaker System

### Daily Loss Limit Breach (2%)
1. **Detection**: Immediate breach detection
2. **Action**: Circuit breaker opens
3. **Response**: All positions closed
4. **Recovery**: 1-hour timeout
5. **Reset**: Automatic reset at market close

### Performance Thresholds
- **Error Rate**: >1% triggers circuit breaker
- **Cache Hit Rate**: <90% triggers alert
- **Memory Usage**: >80% triggers alert
- **CPU Usage**: >80% triggers alert

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Adaptive Timing
