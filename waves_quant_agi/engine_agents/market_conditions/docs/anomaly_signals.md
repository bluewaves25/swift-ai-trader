Known Abnormal Behaviors and Responses
Known Anomalies
The agent identifies and responds to abnormal market behaviors:

Flash Crashes: Sudden price drops (detected by anomaly_amplifier.py), often triggered by high-frequency trading or liquidity shocks.
Sentiment Spikes: Extreme sentiment shifts (e.g., via social_sentiment_analyzer.py) due to news or social media trends.
Macro Shocks: Unexpected rate changes or geopolitical events (monitored by rate_policy_shock_predictor.py, global_event_monitor.py).
Correlation Breakdowns: Disruptions in asset correlations (detected by entanglement_matrix.py), signaling systemic risks.
Chaotic Patterns: High entropy or volatility spikes (via entropy_analyzer.py, volatility_projector.py), indicating unpredictable market states.

Responses

Alert Generation: Anomalies exceeding thresholds (e.g., 0.8 for entropy, 0.7 for volatility) are logged and cached in Redis, with alerts sent to market_conditions_output.
Uncertainty Resolution: uncertainty_solver.py prioritizes deep analysis or monitoring for high-uncertainty anomalies.
Strategy Adjustment: quantum_optimizer.py suggests actions (e.g., hold, reduce exposure) based on anomaly severity.
Feedback Loop: quantum_feedback_loop.py adjusts model parameters to adapt to recurring anomalies.

Mitigation

Proactive Monitoring: Continuous analysis via quantum_web_watch and macro_sensor_fusion ensures early anomaly detection.
Robust Logging: FailureAgentLogger and IncidentCache track anomalies for post-event analysis.
Scalability: Configurable thresholds allow adaptation to new anomaly types.

This ensures the agent mitigates risks and capitalizes on abnormal market opportunities.
