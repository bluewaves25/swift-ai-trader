Training, Retraining, and Signal Fusion
Training Overview
The Quantum Supply-Demand Intelligence Agent uses a hybrid training approach (market_conditions/learning_layer/hybrid_training) to build and refine predictive models for market conditions. Training leverages internal and external data to ensure adaptability and accuracy.
Training Process

Data Sources:
Internal: Model performance metrics (performance_analyzer.py), historical predictions (shift_predictor_fuser.py).
External: Social sentiment (social_sentiment_analyzer.py), financial press (AI_financial_press.py), global events (global_event_monitor.py).


Training Pipeline:
Feature Selection: feature_selector.py identifies key features (e.g., price volatility, sentiment scores) for training.
Model Training: model_trainer.py trains models using quantum-inspired algorithms, integrating signals from q_interpreter.py.
Weight Adjustment: dynamic_weight_updater.py adjusts model weights based on performance feedback.
Learning Rate Optimization: adaptive_learning_rate.py dynamically tunes learning rates for faster convergence.


Quantum-Inspired Methods: q_interpreter.py tests multiple hypotheses in parallel, while entanglement_matrix.py correlates features for robust training.

Retraining

Triggers:
Poor performance (e.g., performance_analyzer.py scores < 0.7).
High entropy or anomalies (e.g., entropy_analyzer.py, anomaly_amplifier.py).
Significant market shifts (e.g., trend_synthesizer.py, market_equilibrium.py).


Process:
Fetch updated data from Redis (e.g., market_conditions:social_sentiment:{symbol}).
Retrain models using model_trainer.py with updated weights and rates.
Resolve uncertainties with uncertainty_solver.py to refine ambiguous signals.


Frequency: Continuous retraining on a configurable schedule (e.g., daily) or triggered by thresholds.

Signal Fusion

Mechanism: shift_predictor_fuser.py combines multiple signals (e.g., sentiment, trends, macro events) into a unified prediction.
Process:
Aggregate scores from social_sentiment_analyzer.py, global_event_monitor.py, and quantum_pattern_recognizer.py.
Apply weights from dynamic_weight_updater.py to prioritize reliable signals.
Use entanglement_matrix.py to detect convergent patterns across signals.


Output: Fused signals (e.g., fused_score > 0.7) cached in Redis and published to market_conditions_output.

Best Practices

Data Quality: Validate inputs using model_validator.py to ensure reliable training data.
Threshold Tuning: Adjust thresholds (e.g., fusion_threshold, rate_threshold) for specific markets or assets.
Monitoring: Use FailureAgentLogger and IncidentCache to track training errors and performance.
Scalability: Leverage Redis for caching training data and results, ensuring low-latency retraining.

This ensures models remain adaptive, accurate, and aligned with dynamic market conditions.
