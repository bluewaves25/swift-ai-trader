Quantum Supply-Demand Intelligence Agent: Overview
Purpose
The Quantum Supply-Demand Intelligence Agent is a core component of the Waves Quant trading platform, designed to analyze real-time market conditions using quantum-inspired algorithms. It integrates external data (e.g., financial press, social media, global events) and internal model performance to provide predictive insights, detect anomalies, and optimize trading decisions.
Why Itâ€™s Critical

Real-Time Awareness: Continuously monitors market signals (e.g., sentiment, macro events) to anticipate supply-demand shifts.
Quantum-Inspired Processing: Leverages parallel hypothesis testing (q_interpreter.py), pattern convergence (entanglement_matrix.py), and uncertainty resolution (uncertainty_solver.py) for robust predictions.
Scalability: Modular design supports multiple assets (e.g., BTC, ETH) and integrates with other agents (e.g., Core, Fees Monitor).
Risk Mitigation: Identifies anomalies and chaotic patterns, enabling proactive risk management in high-frequency trading.

Key Components

Learning Layer: Processes external (e.g., quantum_web_watch, macro_sensor_fusion) and internal data, with adaptive training (hybrid_training).
Quantum Core: Applies quantum-inspired methods for signal interpretation, pattern detection, and uncertainty resolution.
Output: Publishes actionable insights to Redis channel market_conditions_output for Core Agent consumption.

This module ensures the platform remains agile, predictive, and resilient in dynamic markets.
