# Strategy Engine Training Guide: How to Train Your Trading AI

## Overview

Training the Strategy Engine is like teaching a smart student to become an expert trader. The system learns from every trade, adapts to market changes, and continuously improves its strategies. This guide explains how the training process works and how to optimize it for better performance.


## How Training Works

### 1. **Continuous Learning**
The Strategy Engine learns from every single trade it makes:
- **Successful trades**: Learns what worked well
- **Failed trades**: Learns what to avoid
- **Market conditions**: Adapts to changing environments
- **Performance patterns**: Identifies winning combinations

### 2. **Multi-Strategy Training**
Each strategy type learns differently:

#### Trend Following Training
- Analyzes trend strength and duration
