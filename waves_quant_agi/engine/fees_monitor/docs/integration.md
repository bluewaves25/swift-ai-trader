Integration Guide
Purpose
Integrate the Fees Monitor Agent with Core and other agents (e.g., Data Feed, Failure Prevention) to ensure cost accountability in trading systems.
Integration Steps

Redis Configuration:

Subscribe Core Agent to Redis channels ("fee_incident", "profit_report").
Example:from fees_monitor.memory.incident_cache import IncidentCache
cache = IncidentCache(logger)
incidents = cache.retrieve_incidents("fees_monitor:*")




Input Schema:

Trade data from Data Feed Agent:trade = {
  "broker": str,
  "symbol": str,
  "price": float,
  "size": float,
  "gross_pnl": float,
  "expected_price": float,
  "executed_price": float,
  "actual_fees": float,
  "execution_latency": float,
  "market_depth": float
}




Adding New Brokers:

Update broker_fee_db.json with new broker models.
Configure BrokerScraper.scrape_urls for new fee schedules.
Example:model_loader.update_fee_model("new_broker", {"fees": {"commission": 0.002}})




Learning Layer Integration:

Feed external data from ForumChecker, RegulationMonitor to FeeTrainer.
Example:from fees_monitor.learning_layer.hybrid_training.fee_trainer import FeeTrainer
trainer = FeeTrainer(config, logger, cache, research_engine, synthesizer)
dataset = await trainer.prepare_combined_dataset()




Testing:

Simulate trades with varied fees/slippage using mock data.
Verify issue logging in Redis (IncidentCache.retrieve_incidents).
Check TrueProfitReporter for accurate profitability reports.



Best Practices

Use consistent Redis channel names (e.g., "fee_incident").
Validate trade data schemas before processing.
Monitor scraping latency with BrokerScraper and ForumChecker.
Log all actions via FailureAgentLogger to Redis.
Test with scenarios like high slippage or regulatory fee changes.

Dependencies

Libraries: redis, requests, BeautifulSoup, vaderSentiment.
Shared: IncidentCache, FailureAgentLogger for caching/logging.
