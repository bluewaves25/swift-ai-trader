Failure Prevention Agent Workflow
Overview
The Failure Prevention Agent ensures trading system reliability by monitoring health, activating recovery mechanisms, analyzing failures, stress testing, and learning from internal and external data to predict and prevent issues.
Workflow Steps

System Monitoring:

System Health: SystemWatcher tracks CPU, memory, and queue lag, logging issues if thresholds are exceeded.
Agent Behavior: AgentSupervisor monitors agent response times, disabling faulty agents after repeated failures.
Data Integrity: DataIntegrityChecker validates data schemas and values, pausing execution for corrupted inputs.


Circuit Breakers:

Broker Safety: BrokerBreaker halts interactions with faulty brokers if errors exceed thresholds.
Strategy Safety: StrategyBreaker disables strategies causing issues (e.g., infinite loops).
Trade Halt: TradeHaltSwitch triggers a global halt for critical incidents.


Redundancy & Recovery:

Fallback Activation: FallbackManager switches to backup brokers or strategies when primaries fail.
Synchronization: SyncValidator ensures primary and mirror systems remain in sync.


Infrastructure Monitoring:

Network Health: NetworkGuard checks latency and API availability, logging anomalies.
Dependency Health: DependencyHealth monitors Redis and external APIs for connectivity.


Stress Testing:

Load Simulation: LoadSimulator tests CPU and memory under high load.
Network Stress: NetworkSpike simulates rapid API requests to test network resilience.
Failure Analysis: FailureClassifier categorizes failures (e.g., infrastructure, data).


Learning & Improvement:

Internal Analysis: ResearchEngine and TrainingModule analyze and train on internal incidents, with RetrainingLoop updating models.
External Data: TechnicalScraper, MarketSentiment, and IndustryMonitor collect web and social data.
Sentiment & Threats: SentimentProcessor and ThreatCorrelator analyze external signals for risks.
Pattern Synthesis: PatternSynthesizer combines internal/external patterns, with PredictiveAlerts issuing warnings.
Hybrid Training: MultiSourceTrainer trains on combined data, validated by ExternalValidation.


Reporting:

Resilience Reports: ResilienceReport generates weekly reports with failure breakdowns and recommendations.
Logging & Caching: FailureAgentLogger and IncidentCache store issues for traceability.



Circular Nature
The agent runs continuously, with monitoring triggering recovery, analysis feeding learning, and external data enhancing predictions. Resilience reports inform system improvements.
