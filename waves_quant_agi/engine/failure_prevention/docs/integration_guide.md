Integration Guide
Purpose
Integrate Failure Prevention Agent with Core and other agents for robust system monitoring and recovery.
Integration Steps

Configure Redis Channels:

Use FailureAgentLogger and IncidentCache to publish issues to channels (e.g., "failure_incident", "resilience_report").
Configure Core Agent to subscribe via Redis RealtimeSubscriber.
Example:from failure_prevention.memory.incident_cache import IncidentCache
cache = IncidentCache(logger)
incidents = cache.retrieve_incidents("failure_incident:*")




Schema Alignment:

Ensure Core Agent expects schemas from IncidentCache (e.g., type, timestamp, description).
Example schema:schema = {"type": str, "timestamp": float, "description": str}




Add New Monitors:

Create new monitor in monitor/ (e.g., new_monitor.py) with check_health method.
Update failure_prevention/__init__.py to expose the new class.
Register issues in IncidentCache.


Learning Layer Integration:

Feed external data from TechnicalScraper, MarketSentiment, IndustryMonitor to MultiSourceTrainer.
Example:from failure_prevention.learning_layer.hybrid_training.multi_source_trainer import MultiSourceTrainer
trainer = MultiSourceTrainer(internal_trainer, logger, cache)
dataset = trainer.prepare_combined_dataset()




Testing:

Simulate failures with LoadSimulator and NetworkSpike.
Verify issue logging in Redis with IncidentCache.retrieve_incidents.
Check ResilienceReport for recommendations.



Best Practices

Use consistent Redis channel names (e.g., "failure_incident").
Validate all issues with schema checks in Core Agent.
Monitor latency with NetworkGuard and DependencyHealth.
Log all actions in Redis via FailureAgentLogger.
Test with varied failure scenarios (e.g., API downtime, data corruption).
