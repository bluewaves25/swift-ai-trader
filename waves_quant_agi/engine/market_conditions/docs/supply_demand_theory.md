Modern Supply-Demand Theories Used
Core Theories
The Quantum Supply-Demand Intelligence Agent is grounded in modern economic theories tailored for real-time trading:

Dynamic Supply-Demand Equilibrium: Models supply-demand shifts as non-static, incorporating real-time data (e.g., order book changes, social sentiment) to predict price movements.
Behavioral Economics: Integrates sentiment analysis (social_sentiment_analyzer.py, AI_financial_press.py) to account for irrational market behavior driven by investor psychology.
Network Effects: entanglement_matrix.py captures asset interdependencies (e.g., BTC-ETH correlations), reflecting network-driven supply-demand dynamics.
Macro-Micro Integration: Combines macro signals (e.g., rate policies via rate_policy_shock_predictor.py) with micro-level data (e.g., trading volume) for comprehensive analysis.

Application

Real-Time Adjustments: market_equilibrium.py monitors deviations from equilibrium, triggering alerts for significant shifts.
Predictive Modeling: trend_synthesizer.py and volatility_projector.py use these theories to forecast supply-demand imbalances.
Risk Management: uncertainty_solver.py resolves ambiguous conditions using probabilistic models, aligning with dynamic equilibrium principles.

Why Modern Theories?
Traditional models assume static conditions; modern theories account for volatility, irrationality, and interconnectedness, making them ideal for crypto and high-frequency trading markets.
