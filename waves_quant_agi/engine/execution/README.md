QUANTUM_AGENTS Execution Module
The execution/ module is the core of the QUANTUM_AGENTS Execution Agent, designed for ultra-fast trade execution in high-frequency trading (HFT) across Forex, Crypto, Indices, and Commodities. Built in Rust for performance and Python for learning, it ensures low-latency, safe, and optimized trade execution.
Structure

src/core/: Handles trade execution (order_executor.rs), slippage protection (slippage_controller.rs), and dynamic routing (execution_logic.rs).
src/adapter/: Connects to brokers (broker_interface.rs) and handles gRPC/REST APIs (api_bridge.rs).
src/utils/: Tracks latency (latency_monitor.rs) and enforces risk constraints (risk_filters.rs).
learning_layer/: Optimizes execution via Python (internal/, external/, hybrid_training/).

Features

Performance: Sub-millisecond trade execution using Rust.
Safety: Slippage protection and risk filters (e.g., max daily loss, circuit breakers).
Learning: Python layer refines execution parameters (e.g., timing, sizing) via PyO3.
Modularity: Independent components for brokers, models, and strategies.
Integration: Communicates with Market Conditions and Fee Monitor via Redis.

Setup

Install Rust and Python dependencies (Cargo.toml, requirements.txt).
Compile Rust with cargo build.
Build PyO3 bindings with maturin develop.
Configure Redis and broker endpoints in config.yaml.

Usage
Run the execution engine:
cargo run --release
