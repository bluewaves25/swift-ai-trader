Coordination Models
The QUANTUM_AGENTS Execution Agent is designed for future swarm-style coordination with other agents (e.g., Strategy, Risk, Market Conditions) while maintaining execution independence.
Future Coordination Models

Peer-to-Peer: Execution Agents share latency and slippage data via Redis to optimize broker selection across instances.
Hierarchical: A master Execution Agent aggregates signals from multiple sub-agents for high-volume trades.
Swarm: Multiple Execution Agents operate in parallel, coordinating via agent_fusion_engine.py to balance load across brokers.
Feedback-Driven: system_confidence.py and agent_sentiment.py inform other agents of execution reliability, influencing strategy weights.

Implementation Plan

Phase 1: Standardize Redis channels (execution_output, execution_logic) for inter-agent communication.
Phase 2: Extend api_bridge.rs to support cross-agent gRPC endpoints.
Phase 3: Implement swarm logic in agent_fusion_engine.py to aggregate execution signals.
Phase 4: Add state_manager.rs to track multi-agent states for coordination.

Constraints

Execution Agent remains independent, only accepting validated signals.
Coordination avoids tight coupling, using Redis for loose integration.
Future LLMs may interpret coordination logs for dynamic reporting.
