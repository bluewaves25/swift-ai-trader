Learning and Retraining Protocols
Overview
The learning and retraining protocols of the Quantum Supply-Demand Intelligence Agent ensure strategies remain adaptive across Forex, Crypto, Indices, and Commodities. Managed by learning_layer/, these protocols optimize performance using historical and synthetic data.
Training Protocol

Data Preparation:

training_module.py processes historical and synthetic data (e.g., volatility, trend scores).
Features: Volatility, momentum, sentiment; Labels: Profit/loss outcomes.


Model Training:

RandomForestClassifier used with 100 estimators (configurable).
Accuracy threshold: >0.6 for successful training.
Example: Train momentum_rider.py for BTC/USD.


Validation:

external_strategy_validator.py assesses external strategies (>0.7 performance score).
Validated strategies integrated into strategy_engine/types/.



Retraining Protocol

Failure Detection:

research_engine.py identifies strategies with >10% failure rate.
Example: Detect underperformance in pairs_trading.py for ETH/BTC.


Retraining Trigger:

retraining_loop.py triggers retraining every 24 hours or if accuracy <0.5.
Notifies training_module.py via Redis (training_module).


Parameter Optimization:

orchestration_trainer.py refines coordination logic (>0.65 accuracy).
Adjusts thresholds (e.g., momentum_threshold, z_score_threshold).



Integration

Data Sources: Market Conditions Agent via Redis (market_conditions_output).
Feedback: system_predictor.py forecasts performance for retraining prioritization.
Execution: Trained models inform Executions Agent via strategy_engine_output.

Scalability

Supports new strategies (e.g., fed_policy_detector.py) via modular training.
Configurable parameters adapt to assets like Gold or NAS 100.

Robustness

FailureAgentLogger logs training errors.
IncidentCache stores incidents for post-analysis.
Redis ensures persistent state (7-day expiry for training results).
