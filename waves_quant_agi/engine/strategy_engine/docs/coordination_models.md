Strategy Fusion and Collaboration Models
Overview
The Quantum Supply-Demand Intelligence Agent employs strategy fusion and collaboration models to optimize trading decisions across Forex, Crypto, Indices, and Commodities. These models ensure strategies work cohesively, leveraging learning_layer/external/ components.
Fusion Models

Weighted Signal Fusion:

agent_fusion_engine.py combines signals from multiple strategies (e.g., momentum_rider.py, sentiment_analysis.py).
Signals weighted by confidence scores (>0.8 fusion threshold).
Output: Unified buy/sell signal for assets like BTC/USD.


Priority-Based Coordination:

orchestration_cases.py prioritizes strategies based on market conditions (>0.8 priority score).
Example: Prioritize macro_trend_tracker.py for S&P 500 during bullish regimes.


Confidence-Driven Aggregation:

system_confidence.py aggregates system-wide confidence scores (>0.75 threshold).
Enhances signal reliability for high-volatility assets like ETH/USD.



Collaboration Models

Sequential Execution:

Strategies executed in order of priority (e.g., regime_shift_detector.py before adaptive_quote.py).
Ensures alignment with macro trends (e.g., USD/JPY during Fed policy shifts).


Parallel Processing:

Multiple strategies (e.g., pairs_trading.py, volatility_responsive_mm.py) run concurrently.
Redis (strategy_engine_output) synchronizes outputs for Executions Agent.


Feedback Loop:

research_engine.py identifies failure patterns (>10% failure rate).
training_module.py and retraining_loop.py refine strategies based on feedback.



Integration

Data Flow: Market Conditions Agent provides inputs via Redis (market_conditions_output).
Execution: Signals sent to Executions Agent; Fee Monitor ensures cost efficiency.
Risk Management: Risk checks applied before execution.

Scalability

Modular fusion logic supports adding new strategies (e.g., global_liquidity_signal.py).
Configurable thresholds adapt to market dynamics.

Robustness

IncidentCache stores coordination failures for analysis.
FailureAgentLogger logs issues for real-time monitoring.
