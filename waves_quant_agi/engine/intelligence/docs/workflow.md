Intelligence Agent Workflow
Overview
The Intelligence Agent orchestrates other agents (e.g., Core, Fees Monitor) to ensure system-level synergy, optimizing performance, resolving conflicts, and evolving coordination strategies through AI-driven analysis.
Workflow Steps

Performance Evaluation:

Collect metrics (speed, accuracy, cost, error rate) via Redis (IncidentCache).
Analyze correlations (CorrelationMatrix), detect anomalies (AnomalyDetector), and optimize timing (TimingWindowOptimizer).


Graph-Based Modeling:

Build agent relationship graph (AgentGraphBuilder).
Train GNN for coordination (CoordinationGNN) and monitor feedback loops (FeedbackLoopMonitor).


Online Learning:

Score agents with reinforcement learning (ReinforcementScorer).
Schedule periodic coordination updates (EvolutionScheduler).
Train on feedback (AgentFeedbackTrainer) to adjust priorities.


Transformer-Based Analysis:

Model interactions with BERT (InterAgentTransformer).
Resolve conflicts (ConflictResolver) and explain decisions (ModelExplainer).


Learning Layer:

Internal: Analyze coordination patterns (ResearchEngine), train models (TrainingModule), and retrain periodically (RetrainingLoop).
External: Scrape AI research (AILabScraper), case studies (OrchestrationCases), architecture trends (ArchitectureMonitor), and analyze sentiment (AgentSentiment, SystemConfidence).
Fusion: Combine insights (AgentFusionEngine) and predict risks (SystemPredictor).
Hybrid Training: Train on combined data (OrchestrationTrainer) and validate strategies (ExternalStrategyValidator).


Output:

Publish optimizations, resolutions, and risks to Redis channel "intelligence_instruction".



Scalability

Config-driven thresholds and URLs support new agents and data sources.
Redis caching ensures low-latency data access.

Dependencies

Libraries: pandas, networkx, torch, torch_geometric, transformers, vaderSentiment, requests, BeautifulSoup.
Shared: IncidentCache, FailureAgentLogger for caching/logging.
