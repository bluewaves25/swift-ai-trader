Training the Adapters Agent
To optimize the Adapters Agent's performance, training focuses on improving its learning, routing, and retry mechanisms. Below are best practices for training:
1. Data Collection

Historical Data:
Collect order execution logs (logs/*.log) for each broker.
Include latency, error rates, fees, and order details.


API Responses:
Store broker API responses to identify error patterns.


Broker Documentation:
Regularly update APIMonitor with current API documentation URLs.



2. Simulating Scenarios

Test Orders:
Simulate various order types (market, limit) and sizes across brokers.
Use mock APIs to test edge cases (e.g., rate limits, KYC restrictions).


Failure Injection:
Simulate broker downtime, high latency, or API errors to train PatternAnalyzer and RetryHandler.


API Changes:
Mock API version changes to train APIMonitor for adaptation.



3. Training the Learning Layer

Pattern Analysis:
Feed historical failure data to PatternAnalyzer to identify common errors and peak failure times.
Example: Run analyze_patterns(broker_name) on log data to detect trends like "Binance slows on Sunday nights."


Broker Intelligence:
Train BrokerIntelligence with performance metrics and failure patterns to refine recommendations.
Example: Adjust priorities by simulating high error rates for a broker.


Feedback Loop:
Use recommendations to update BrokerRouter strategies, then test routing decisions.



4. Optimizing Retry Logic

Success Rate Analysis:
Calculate success rates from logs and feed to RetryHandler.adjust_retry_params.
Example: Lower base_delay for brokers with >80% success rate.


Backoff Testing:
Simulate repeated failures to optimize exponential backoff parameters.
Adjust max_retries and max_delay based on broker reliability.



5. Monitoring and Validation

Health Checks:
Train HealthChecker with simulated broker outages to ensure accurate status reporting.


Performance Metrics:
Validate PerformanceTracker by comparing logged metrics with expected outcomes.


Log Analysis:
Regularly review BrokerLogger outputs to ensure all actions and errors are captured.



6. Continuous Improvement

Incremental Training:
Periodically retrain PatternAnalyzer and BrokerIntelligence with new data.


Broker Addition:
Add new brokers (see integration_guide.md) and train with their specific quirks.


Automation:
Schedule automated training runs using historical and simulated data to keep the agent adaptive.



Best Practices

Diverse Data: Use varied order types, market conditions, and failure scenarios.
Validation: Test recommendations against real-world performance to avoid overfitting.
Logging: Ensure BrokerLogger captures all training data for auditing.
Scalability: Design training scripts to handle additional brokers seamlessly.
Monitoring: Use HealthChecker and APIMonitor to validate training in real-time.

Example Training Script
from adapters.learning_layer import PatternAnalyzer, BrokerIntelligence
from adapters.status_monitor import PerformanceTracker

analyzer = PatternAnalyzer()
tracker = PerformanceTracker()
intelligence = BrokerIntelligence(analyzer)

# Simulate failures
for _ in range(100):
    analyzer.log_failure("binance", "RateLimitError", {"amount": 0.1, "type": "market"})

# Analyze patterns
patterns = analyzer.analyze_patterns("binance")

# Update recommendations
tracker.record_response("binance", latency=0.5, success=True, fee=0.001)
intelligence.update_recommendations("binance", tracker.get_broker_metrics()["binance"])
