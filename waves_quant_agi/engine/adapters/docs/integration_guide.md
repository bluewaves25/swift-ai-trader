Integration Guide: Adding a New Broker
Steps to Add a New Broker

Create Adapter:

Add a new file in adapters/broker_integrations/, e.g., new_broker_adapter.py.
Implement a class inheriting from BaseAdapter.
Override methods: format_order, send_order, confirm_order, handle_broker_quirks.
Example:from .base_adapter import BaseAdapter

class NewBrokerAdapter(BaseAdapter):
    def __init__(self, api_key: str, api_secret: str):
        super().__init__("new_broker", api_key, api_secret)
        # Initialize client (e.g., ccxt or custom HTTP client)

    def format_order(self, order):
        # Convert internal order to broker-specific format
        pass

    async def send_order(self, formatted_order):
        # Send order to broker API
        pass

    def confirm_order(self, order_id):
        # Verify order status
        pass

    def handle_broker_quirks(self, order):
        # Handle broker-specific constraints
        pass




Update Imports:

Add the new adapter to adapters/broker_integrations/__init__.py:from .new_broker_adapter import NewBrokerAdapter
__all__ = [..., "NewBrokerAdapter"]




Register Adapter:

Update the BrokerRouter initialization in your application to include the new adapter:adapters = {..., "new_broker": NewBrokerAdapter(api_key, api_secret)}
router = BrokerRouter(adapters, performance_tracker)




Update Monitoring:

Add the broker to HealthChecker and APIMonitor configurations:brokers = {..., "new_broker": "https://api.newbroker.com/docs"}
api_monitor = APIMonitor(brokers)




Test Integration:

Validate order formatting, sending, and confirmation using test orders.
Monitor logs in logs/new_broker.log for errors or anomalies.
Ensure PatternAnalyzer and BrokerIntelligence capture new broker data.



Best Practices

Use ccxt.async_support for brokers it supports to simplify API interactions.
Handle broker-specific quirks (e.g., decimal precision, rate limits) in handle_broker_quirks.
Log all requests and errors using BrokerLogger.
Test API changes by simulating responses in api_monitor.py.
Update api_documentation.md with new broker API details.
