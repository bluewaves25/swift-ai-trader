Quantum Inference Benefits
The quantum_risk_core/ module leverages quantum-inspired algorithms to enhance risk management in Waves Quant.
Key Benefits

Speed: Quantum Monte Carlo (quantum_monte_carlo.py) accelerates entropy computation for real-time HFT.
Parallelism: ParallelOutcomeEvaluator simulates multiple market scenarios simultaneously, improving risk foresight.
Uncertainty Handling: UncertaintyEntropyModel quantifies market uncertainty, triggering GracefulFallbackEngine for conservative strategies.
Scalability: Processes high-dimensional data across Forex, Crypto, Indices, and Commodities.

Implementation

Integrates with Redis for real-time data from Market Conditions and Fee Monitor agents.
Uses entropy thresholds (e.g., 80%) to balance risk and opportunity.
Outputs stored in Redis with 1-hour expiry for execution integration.
Logs failures via FailureAgentLogger for transparency and retraining.

Advantages

Reduces latency in risk assessment for HFT.
Enhances resilience against black swan events.
Supports continuous learning via learning_layer/ integration.
