Risk Management Architecture Overview
The risk_management/ module of Waves Quant acts as a "neural shield," protecting trading operations across Forex, Crypto, Indices, and Commodities. It integrates high-frequency trading (HFT), quantum-parallel inference, and continuous learning to ensure robust risk control.
Core Components

Strategy-Specific Risk Control: Tailors risk logic to strategies like arbitrage, trend-following, and market-making.
Simulation Engine: Runs stress tests and scenarios to evaluate risk under adverse conditions.
Audit Trails: Ensures transparency with visual traces and redundancy checks.
Quantum Risk Core: Uses quantum-inspired models for entropy and outcome evaluation.
Learning Layer: Continuously improves risk models via internal and external data analysis.

Integration

Communicates with Market Conditions, Executions, and Fee Monitor agents via Redis.
Supports trading in EUR/USD, USD/JPY, BTC, ETH, SOL, US 30, NAS 100, S&P 500, Gold, Silver, and Oil.

Design Principles

Modularity for scalability.
Real-time risk assessment for HFT.
Continuous learning for adaptive risk management.
Transparency through comprehensive logging and visualization.
