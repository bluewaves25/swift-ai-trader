Risk Models
The risk_management/ module employs advanced risk models to quantify and mitigate risks in trading.
Value at Risk (VaR)

Measures potential loss in portfolio value over a specific time horizon at a given confidence level.
Calculated using historical simulation and Monte Carlo methods.
Example: 95% VaR of $100,000 indicates a 5% chance of losing more than $100,000 in a day.

Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)

Estimates expected loss in the worst-case scenarios beyond VaR.
Provides a more comprehensive risk assessment for tail events.
Used to set capital buffers for extreme market conditions.

Entropy-Based Uncertainty Model

Quantifies uncertainty in market dynamics using information entropy.
High entropy triggers conservative strategies via the GracefulFallbackEngine.
Computed using quantum-inspired Monte Carlo simulations for speed.

Implementation

Models integrate with quantum_risk_core/ for parallel processing.
Configurable thresholds (e.g., 80% entropy) ensure adaptability.
Results stored in Redis and logged via FailureAgentLogger for transparency.
