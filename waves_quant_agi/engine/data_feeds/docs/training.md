Training the Data Feed Agent
Objective
Optimize data feed processing and signal generation through training on historical and simulated data.
1. Data Collection

Stored Data:
Retrieve price, sentiment, order book, trade tape, and microstructure data from DBConnector.
Example: db.backfill("crypto_price:*").


Indicators and Signals:
Collect RSI, VWAP, and generated signals from Indicators and SignalGenerator.


External Data:
Incorporate market data from external sources via ResearchEngine.collect_training_data.



2. Simulating Scenarios

Mock Feeds:
Simulate price, trade, and order book data for testing.
Example: {"symbol": "BTCUSDT", "price": 50000.0, "volume": 10.0, "timestamp": 1234567890.0}.


Sentiment Simulation:
Generate mock sentiment scores for keywords (TwitterSentiment, NewsScraper).


Edge Cases:
Test with missing fields, extreme prices, or high volatility to ensure robustness.



3. Training the Learning Layer

Research Engine:
Analyze feed behavior with ResearchEngine.analyze_feed_behavior() to identify patterns (e.g., volatility, data gaps).
Example: Detect frequent price spikes for specific symbols.


Training Module:
Prepare datasets with TrainingModule.prepare_dataset() including features like price, sentiment, and slippage.
Train model with TrainingModule.train_model(dataset) to optimize signal generation.


Retraining Loop:
Schedule RetrainingLoop.run_retraining() for periodic updates.



4. Validation

Data Quality:
Verify data consistency using SchemaValidator and DataCleaner.


Signal Accuracy:
Compare generated signals against historical outcomes in DBConnector.


Latency:
Ensure processing meets latency targets (data_latency.md).



5. Best Practices

Diverse Data: Include varied asset classes and data types in datasets.
Incremental Updates: Retrain with small batches to avoid overfitting.
Traceability: Store all training data and metrics in Redis.
Simulation: Test with mock data before live integration.
Scalability: Design datasets to support new feeds or indicators.

Example Training Script
from data_feeds.cache.db_connector import DBConnector
from data_feeds.learning_layer import ResearchEngine, TrainingModule, RetrainingLoop

db = DBConnector()
research = ResearchEngine(db)
training = TrainingModule(db)
retraining = RetrainingLoop(training, db)

# Simulate data
db.store({"symbol": "BTCUSDT", "price": 50000.0, "volume": 10.0, "timestamp": 1234567890.0})

# Analyze and train
analysis = research.analyze_feed_behavior()
dataset = training.prepare_dataset()
training.train_model(dataset)
